A bank has hired us as a data scientist and we have to create a model that predicts whether a customer would stay with the bank or leave the bank with the help of data provided by the bank itself. 
Data in use is labelled as ChurnModelling, and I have provided two similar but different set of codes which could be used to create the predictive model.
